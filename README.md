## Personal details

I am 30 years old. My first profession was a math teacher, so my main skill is the ability to learn which helps me a lot.
Two years ago I decided to change my profession and became a front-end developer.

**_Position_:** frond-end developer

All this time I have been working in a team that included not only developers, 
but also business analysts and quality assurance specialists, 
using the SCRUM methodology hence can work as part of a team that solves problems together.

I am currently working on an application for creating and passing tests and practical programming tasks. 
As a part of this project, I have implemented about 50 features and improvements. 
Among them there are several ones at the back end, for example, obfuscation of user data.
